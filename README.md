<h1>Quick Engine</h1>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Quick Engine is a simple game engine designed to allow the easy creation of games using Java Graphics2D and Swing. The engine creates all of the rendering and game loops to create a simple plug and play solution to making games.</p> 
<p>  In addition, the engine will come with several utility classes and methods designed to assist in the creation of 2D games. These include the AudioManager, InputListener, Animation, and the Utils class and methods.</p>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
<hr>
<p>To use the engine, simply either drop the file into your project folder, or add the jar library to your project's build path. Instructions on how to use the engine itself are currently WIP, but there is commenting and documentation within the engine code that can help.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<hr>
<p>Currently there is no real plan in place for the development of Quick Engine, as this is just a project I am working on for fun. I hope to add more features to make it easier to build games, and make the engine more useful and versatile for the development of 2D games.</p>
<p>  There are a few ideas for future features I have had in mind, those including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding a physics component to the engine</li>
  <li>Adding an entity management system</li>
  <li>Adding support for 3D as well?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind these are just ideas and may or may not be implemented. They also are not intended to be implemented in any specific order and could take some time.</p>
